# GeyserUpdater
> Updating Geyser with ease.


This plugin allows you to update geyser without much effort.
Update Geyser with Command or you can set an Auto Update.

## Downloading

To download you can either go to the actions button in the github bar and download a zip with a jar inside or go to releases on the right of your screen and download the jar there.

## Installation

GeyserUpdater can be installed on Spigot & Bungeecord. Place the updater in the plugins folder and restart the server.


Permissions:
```
gupdater.geyserupdate
```

Commands:

```
/geyserupdate 
```

Auto-Updating:

```
You can set Auto-Updating on true in the config.yml.
```

## Usage

After you ran the command or enabled auto updating, it will check the current running geyser version. if its outdated it will automatic download the latest Geyser Build!
Changes will only take place once the server has been restarted.

## Restart/reload

Please do not use the Reload command. this can cause errors on the geyser part. and most likely will break your server.
